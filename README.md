# NLP-Based Chatbot

Welcome to the **NLP-Based Chatbot** project! This chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interact with users in a conversational manner. The chatbot is trained using a dataset derived from Wikipedia, allowing it to provide informative responses to a wide range of queries.

## Features

- **Conversational AI:** The chatbot can engage in conversations with users, providing relevant and context-aware responses.
- **Wikipedia Dataset:** The bot is trained on a dataset derived from Wikipedia, enabling it to have knowledge across various topics.
- **NLP Techniques:** The project implements various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and more to process and understand user input.
- **Customizable Responses:** Easily modify or extend the bot's knowledge base and response patterns.
- **Multi-Turn Conversations:** The chatbot can handle multi-turn conversations, maintaining context across multiple exchanges.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language used for developing the chatbot.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Used for NLP-related tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Wikipedia Dataset:** The dataset used for training the chatbot, containing various articles and information extracted from Wikipedia.
- **Artificial Intelligence**
## Usage

Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it by entering text inputs. The bot will process your input, analyze it using NLP techniques, and generate an appropriate response based on the Wikipedia dataset.

### Example Interaction

```
User: What is natural language processing?
Bot: Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language.
```

## Customization

- **Modify Responses:** You can customize the bot's responses by editing the response patterns or training it with a different dataset.
- **Extend Functionality:** Implement additional NLP techniques or integrate the bot with a web-based interface using Flask.
